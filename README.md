# HockeyContract
Team Contract for Mobile final project (Hockey Goaltender Evaluation)

Expectations:

Our group will evenly distribute the work that has been given with each of us assuming the leadership positions that we have assigned each other (see below). Everyone in the group is expected to participate and be proactive in completing our project. Even though we have not gotten the details for the project yet, the expectation is to meet routinely to maintain organization and communicate heavily in order to be the most efficient we can be. If breech of contract occurs, then Dr. Goadrich will be called into action to help us delegate whatever issues arise. 

Roles:

Task Manager: Sam

Client Interfacer: Sarah

Unit Tester: Colten

Integration Tester: Jack

Beta Test Organizer: Eliana



Sam: My role is the task manager. I will lead the delegation of tasks to help keep our team on pace and imoprove the efficiancy of our project. My goal is to help people have roles they can succeed in. I plan on working with my team and being reachable as well as staying up to date on my assigments and asking for help when I need it.



Sarah:
My role in this project is the client interfacer. I will be responsible for communicating with the client, ensuring we have the information we need to complete the project and addressing any pertinent issues from our end. Beyond client communication, I plan to contribute actively to the development process. I will maintain clear and timely communication with both the client and the team, ensuring that we stay aligned with the project’s objectives and timeline.


<u>Jack: <u> 
I plan on being proactive and completing my share of work for this project.I am the integration tester, so I am in charge of ensuring that all of the components of our app are compatible with each other. I understand my role for the team as well the neccessary measures that I need to take to ensure that our group creates a functional app that works as intended for our client. Communication, organization, and time management will be major determinants in how well our project will go, so our group will try our best to make sure these are all in check.


Eliana: My role in this project is the beta test organizer. My role comes into work towards the end of the project to ensure the code runs as expected and without substantial bugs through the process of beta-testing the code with real users to get feedback before publishing a final product. I will work with our project partners to find real users to beta test the product and provide feedback on what needs to be changed or ideas to improve quality before finishing the project. I plan on communicating with my team and attending regular meetings to work on the project together and discuss progress. I plan on being open if I need assitance on a portion of my tasks and willing to assist others if they need it. Collaboration will be a huge part of out success in this project, so we will ensure to work together ina productive and effective way to meet deadlines and make progress.



Colten: unit tester
My role is the unit tester. I will ensure that unit tests are written and working. While I am not necessarily responsible
for writing all of the unit tests myself, I am responsible for making sure they are done in a timely manner and are working 
at each stage of development. In the course of development, it is likely that I will also help in other areas of development. 
In order to ensure that this responsibility is carried out, I will personally run all unit tests at the beginning and end of each 
group meeting to ensure they are working. Additionally, before development begins, I will have a plan for what features will be 
implemented and know what aspects of our app need unit tests. If unit tests fail, then I will make it a priority next group meeting 
to ensure that they pass next meeting. To have a positive team experience, I feel that accountability, transparency, and respect 
are key. I plan to hold myself, and the rest of the team, accountable for doing work assigned to them. I plan on being transparent 
on what I can feasably do and how much time I can realistically put into this project with my other obligations. Finally, I will 
show respect to my groupmates and our clients. I will respect their time and their thoughts on the project.
