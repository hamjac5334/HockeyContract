# HockeyContract
Team Contract for Mobile final project (Hockey Goaltender Evaluation)

Expectations:

Our group will evenly distribute the work that has been given with each of us assuming the leadership positions that we have assigned each other (see below). Everyone in the group is expected to participate and be proactive in completing our project. Even though we have not gotten the details for the project yet, the expectation is to meet routinely to maintain organization and communicate heavily in order to be the most efficient we can be. If breech of contract occurs, then Dr. Goadrich will be called into action to help us delegate whatever issues arise. 

Roles:

<u>Jack: <u>

I plan on being proactive and completing my share of work for this project.I am the integration tester, so I am in charge of ensuring that all of the components of our app are compatible with each other. I understand my role for the team as well the neccessary measures that I need to take to ensure that our group creates a functional app that works as intended for our client. Communication, organization, and time management will be major determinants in how well our project will go, so our group will try our best to make sure these are all in check.
