Team Contract for Mobile final project (Hockey Goaltender Evaluation)



Colten: unit tester
My role is the unit tester. I will ensure that unit tests are written and working. While I am not necessarily responsible
for writing all of the unit tests myself, I am responsible for making sure they are done in a timely manner and are working 
at each stage of development. In the course of development, it is likely that I will also help in other areas of development. 
In order to ensure that this responsibility is carried out, I will personally run all unit tests at the beginning and end of each 
group meeting to ensure they are working. Additionally, before development begins, I will have a plan for what features will be 
implemented and know what aspects of our app need unit tests. If unit tests fail, then I will make it a priority next group meeting 
to ensure that they pass next meeting. To have a positive team experience, I feel that accountability, transparency, and respect 
are key. I plan to hold myself, and the rest of the team, accountable for doing work assigned to them. I plan on being transparent 
on what I can feasably do and how much time I can realistically put into this project with my other obligations. Finally, I will 
show respect to my groupmates and our clients. I will respect their time and their thoughts on the project.
